## Playground Goals
### Our goal: 
Have prospects and customers understand **what ActionKit is and what the value is**. We want to give them a frictionless experience 
on using actionkit and demo a few popular use cases

### Why our audience cares: 
they want to learn more about what actionkit is and what/how they can build with it

### Customer journey: 
we assume that the audience has some context of what Paragon and Actionkit is. We will provide tooltips, links to docs, 
api calls, and an intro page to remind/provide the audience with additional context on what ActionKit is and use cases they can 
build with it.

We do not require them to signup for a trial or use their own Paragon credentials.

### Customer takeways:
As a prospect/customer evaluating ActionKit, I would like a resource to help me understand the mechanics 
and value of ActionKit, so that I can decide on if ActionKit would be useful to my product.

After visiting the playground, customers should:
1) understand that ActionKit is providing an API that makes it easy to call integrated 3rd-party APIs
2) be encouraged to test actions and start thinking about how it fits in their product
3) be exposed to use cases that resonate with integration use cases they're looking to build
4) explore the ActionKit docs
5) signup for a trial (if not an existing customer)


### Measuring success:
* hockeystack measurements
* positive feedback from sales team on prospects that have used the playground
    * feedback that the playground helped them understand the value of ActionKit
    * feedback that the use cases are also use cases they'd like to build
